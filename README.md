## About Me 🙋🏻🏳️‍🌈

My prior career was spent developing physical objects for humans to enjoy, and teaching others to do the same. From fancy chairs to wooden boats to theater sets, I designed, modeled, built and tested it all. Then I woke up one day and couldn't walk.

In the long haul of recovery I got curious about developing digital objects, dipped my toes into programming, and have been hooked ever since. I'll graduate with an AAS in Web Development in May of 2024 with a focus on front-end and accessibility. I love bringing innovative ideas to life and want to make the web a more equitable, uplifting space. 🪜🤲
