## About Me 🙋🏻🏳️‍🌈

My prior career was spent developing physical objects for humans to enjoy and teaching others to do the same. From fancy chairs to wooden boats to theatrical sets, I designed, modeled, tested, and built it all. Then I woke up one day and couldn't walk.

In the slog of recovery I got curious about developing digital objects, dipped my toes into programming, and have been hooked ever since. As a lifelong design-build nerd, I value craftsmanship and endeavor to balance form and function in all that I do. I love bringing innovative ideas to performant life and am eager to contribute toward a more equitable, diverse web. 🪜🤲
