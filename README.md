## About Me 🙋🏻🏳️‍🌈

My prior career was spent developing physical objects for humans to enjoy, and teaching others to do the same. From fancy chairs to wooden boats to theater sets, I designed, modeled, built and tested it all. Then I woke up one day and couldn't walk.

In the long haul of recovery I got curious about developing digital objects, dipped my toes into programming, and have been hooked ever since. I'll graduate with an AAS in Web Development in May of 2024. I love bringing unqiue, challenging ideas to life and hope to make the web a more equitable, uplifting space. 🪜🤲
